## Problem Statement
Recent increases in structural failures, such as collapsing walls, bridges, and airport ceilings, are often due to contractors using substandard materials to maximize profits. The lack of transparency and accountability in the current system results in unsafe structures, increased accidents, and difficulty in holding contractors accountable. To address this, we propose a decentralized application (DApp) using blockchain technology to ensure transparent and quality-driven construction contract management. The DApp will feature a transparent bidding process, immutable records, a reputation system for contractors, and automated compliance with construction standards. This solution aims to reduce structural failures, enhance accountability, restore public trust, and streamline contract management processes in the constructionÂ industry.
